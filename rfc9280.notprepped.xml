    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies version 3 of the RFC Editor Model. The model 
defines two high-level tasks related to the RFC Series. First, policy 
definition is the joint responsibility of the RFC Series Working Group 
(RSWG), which produces policy proposals, and the RFC Series Approval 
Board (RSAB), which approves such proposals. Second, policy 
implementation is primarily the responsibility of the RFC Production 
Center (RPC) as contractually overseen by the IETF Administration
Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC).  In addition, various 
responsibilities of the RFC Editor function are now performed alone
or in combination by the RSWG, RSAB, RPC, RFC Series Consulting Editor 
(RSCE), and IETF LLC. Finally, this document establishes the Editorial 
Stream for publication of future policy definition documents produced 
through the processes defined herein.</t>
      <t>This document obsoletes RFC 8728. This document updates RFCs 7841,
8729, and 8730.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The Request for Comments (RFC) Series is the archival series
dedicated to documenting Internet technical specifications,
including general contributions from the Internet research and
engineering community as well as standards documents. RFCs are 
available free of charge to anyone via the Internet. As described
in <xref target="RFC8700"/>, RFCs have been published continually since 1969.</t>
      <t>RFCs are generated and approved by multiple document streams. 
Whereas the stream approving body <xref target="RFC8729"/> for each stream is 
responsible for the content of that stream, the RFC Editor function 
is responsible for the production and distribution of all RFCs. 
The four existing streams are described in <xref target="RFC8729"/>. This 
document adds a fifth stream, the Editorial Stream, for publication
of policies governing the RFC Series as a whole.</t>
      <t>The overall framework for the RFC Series and the RFC Editor
function is described in <xref target="RFC8729"/> and is updated by this 
document, which defines version 3 of the RFC Editor Model. 
Under this version, various responsibilities of the RFC Editor 
function are performed alone or in combination by the RFC Series
Working Group (RSWG), RFC Series Advisory Board (RSAB), RFC
Production Center (RPC), RFC Series Consulting Editor (RSCE), and 
IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC) <xref target="RFC8711"/>, 
which collectively comprise the RFC Editor function. The intent 
is to ensure sustainable maintenance and support of the RFC Series 
based on the principles of expert implementation, clear management 
and direction, and appropriate community input <xref target="RFC8729"/>.</t>
      <t>This document obsoletes <xref target="RFC8728"/> by defining version 3 
of the RFC Editor Model. This document updates <xref target="RFC7841"/> 
by defining boilerplate text for the Editorial Stream. This 
document updates <xref target="RFC8729"/> by replacing the RFC Editor role
with the RSWG, RSAB, and RSCE. This document updates <xref target="RFC8730"/>
by removing the dependency on certain policies specified by the
IAB and RFC Series Editor (RSE). More detailed information about changes from 
version 2 of the RFC Editor Model can be found in <xref target="changes"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="overview-of-the-model">
      <name>Overview of the Model</name>
      <t>This document divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series 
into two high-level tasks:</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>Policy definition governing the RFC Series as a whole. This is
the joint responsibility of two entities. First, the RFC Series Working 
Group (RSWG) is an open working group independent of the IETF that 
generates policy proposals. Second, the RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB) 
is an appointed body that approves such proposals for publication 
in the Editorial Stream. The RSAB includes representatives of the 
streams <xref target="RFC8729"/> as well as an expert in technical publishing, 
the RFC Series Consulting Editor (RSCE).</li>
        <li>Policy implementation through publication of RFCs in all of the 
streams that form the RFC Series. This is primarily the responsibility 
of the RFC Production Center (RPC) as contractually overseen by the 
IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC) <xref target="RFC8711"/>.</li>
      </ol>
      <t>As described more fully in the remainder of this document, the core
activities and responsibilities are as follows:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>The RSWG proposes policies that govern the RFC Series as a whole, with
input from the community, the RSAB, and the RSCE.</li>
        <li>The RSAB considers those proposals and either approves them or returns 
them to the RSWG, which may make further changes or remove them from
further consideration.</li>
        <li>If approved, such proposals are published as RFCs in the Editorial
Stream and thus define the policies to be followed by the RSWG, RSAB,
RSCE, and RPC.</li>
        <li>The RSCE provides expert advice to the RPC and RSAB on how to implement
established policies on an ongoing and operational basis, which can include
raising issues or initiating proposed policy changes within the RSWG.</li>
        <li>The RPC implements the policies defined by the Editorial Stream in its
day-to-day editing and publication of RFCs from all of the streams.</li>
        <li>If issues arise with the implementation of particular policies, the RPC
brings those issues to the RSAB, which interprets the policies and provides
interim guidance to the RPC, informing the RSWG of those interpretations.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>This model is designed to ensure public processes and policy documents,
clear lines of responsibility and authority, transparent mechanisms for updates and changes to policies
governing the RFC Series as a whole, and effective operational implementation of the
RFC Series, thus meeting the requirements specified in <xref target="RFC8729" sectionFormat="of" section="4"/>.</t>
      <t>The remainder of this document describes the model in greater detail.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="policy-definition">
      <name>Policy Definition</name>
      <t>Policies governing the RFC Series as a whole are defined through the 
following high-level process:</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>Proposals must be submitted to, adopted by, and discussed within the RFC
Series Working Group (RSWG).</li>
        <li>Proposals must pass a Last Call for comments in the working group and 
a community call for comments (see <xref target="cfc"/>).</li>
        <li>Proposals must be approved by the RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB).</li>
      </ol>
      <t>Policies under the purview of the RSWG and RSAB might include, but are
not limited to, document formats, processes for publication and
dissemination of RFCs, and overall management of the RFC Series.</t>

            <t>The RFC Series Working Group (RSWG) is the primary venue in which 
members of the community collaborate regarding the policies that 
govern the RFC Series.</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="participation">
            <name>Participation</name>
<t>All interested individuals are welcome to participate in the RSWG;
participants are subject to anti-harassment policies as described in <xref
target="coc"/>.  This includes but is not limited to participants in the IETF
and IRTF, members of the IAB and IESG, developers of software or hardware
systems that implement RFCs, authors of RFCs and Internet-Drafts, developers
of tools used to author or edit RFCs and Internet-Drafts, individuals who use
RFCs in procurement decisions, scholarly researchers, and representatives of
standards development organizations other than the IETF and IRTF. The IETF LLC
Board members, staff and contractors (especially representatives of the RFC
Production Center), and the IETF Executive Director are invited to participate
as community members in the RSWG to the extent permitted by any relevant IETF
LLC policies. Members of the RSAB are also expected to participate
actively.</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="chairs">
            <name>Chairs</name>
            <t>The RSWG shall have two chairs, one appointed by the IESG and the
other appointed by the IAB. When the RSWG is formed, the chair
appointed by the IESG shall serve for a term of one (1) year and
the chair appointed by the IAB shall serve for a term of two (2)
years; thereafter, chairs shall serve for a term of two (2)
years, with no term limits on renewal. The IESG and IAB shall
determine their own processes for making these appointments, making
sure to take account of any potential conflicts of interest.
Community members who have concerns about the performance of an
RSWG Chair should direct their feedback to the appropriate appointing 
body via mechanisms such bodies shall specify at the time that the
RSWG is formed. The IESG and IAB shall have the power to remove their
appointed chairs at their discretion at any time and to name a
replacement who shall serve the remainder of the original chair's
term.</t>
            <t>It is the responsibility of the chairs to encourage rough consensus
within the RSWG and to follow that consensus in their decision making,
for instance, regarding acceptance of new proposals and advancement of
proposals to the RSAB.</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="mode-of-operation">
            <name>Mode of Operation</name>
            <t>The intent is that the RSWG shall operate in a way similar to that of working 
groups in the IETF. Therefore, all 
RSWG meetings and discussion venues shall be open to all interested 
individuals, and all RSWG contributions shall be subject to intellectual 
property policies, which must be consistent with those of the IETF as 
specified in <xref target="BCP78"/> and <xref target="BCP79"/>.</t>
            <t>When the RSWG is formed, all discussions shall take place on an
open email discussion list, which shall be publicly archived.</t>
            <t>The RSWG is empowered to hold in-person, online-only, or hybrid meetings,
which should be announced with sufficient notice to enable broad
participation; the <eref target="https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/interim-meetings-guidance-2016-01-16/">IESG Guidance on Face-to-Face and Virtual Interim
Meetings</eref> 
provides a reasonable baseline. In-person meetings should include
provision for effective online participation for those unable to
attend in person.</t>
            <t>The RSWG shall operate by rough consensus, a mode of operation
informally described in <xref target="RFC2418"/>.</t>
            <t>The RSWG may decide by rough consensus to use additional tooling 
(e.g., GitHub as specified in <xref target="RFC8874"/>), forms of communication, 
and working methods (e.g., design teams) as long as they are consistent 
with this document and with <xref target="RFC2418"/> or its successors.</t>
            <t>Absent specific guidance in this document regarding the operation
of the RSWG, the general guidance provided in <xref target="RFC2418" sectionFormat="of" section="6"/> 
should be considered appropriate.</t>
            <t>The IETF LLC is requested to provide necessary tooling to support 
RSWG communication, decision processes, and policies.</t>
            <t>The IAB is requested to convene the RSWG when it is first formed in
order to formalize the IAB's transfer of authority over the RFC Editor 
Model.</t>

            <t>The RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB), which includes representatives 
of all of the streams, shall act as the approving body for proposals 
generated within the RSWG, thus providing an appropriate set of checks 
and balances on the output of the RSWG. The only policy-making role
of the RSAB is to review policy proposals generated by the RSWG; it shall
have no independent authority to formulate policy on its own. It is
expected that the RSAB will respect the rough consensus of the
RSWG wherever possible, without ceding its responsibility to 
review RSWG proposals, as further described in <xref target="workflow"/>.</t>

          <section anchor="members">
            <name>Members</name>
	    <t>The RSAB consists primarily of the following voting members:</t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>A stream representative for the IETF Stream: either an IESG member
or someone appointed by the IESG</li>

Independent Submissions Editor (ISE) <xref target="RFC8730"/> or someone
appointed by the ISE</li>

            </ul>
            <t>If and when a new stream is created, the document that
creates the stream shall specify if a voting member representing
that stream shall also be added to the RSAB, along with any rules
and processes related to that representative (e.g., whether the
representative is a member of the body responsible for the stream
or an appointed delegate thereof).</t>
            <t>The RFC Series Consulting Editor (RSCE) is a voting member of the
RSAB but does not act as a representative of the Editorial Stream.</t>

include the following non-voting, ex officio members:</t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>The IETF Executive Director or their delegate (the rationale is 
that the IETF LLC is accountable for implementation of policies

is that the RPC is responsible for implementation of policies
governing the RFC Series)</li>
            </ul>
            <t>In addition, the RSAB may include
other non-voting members at its discretion; these non-voting members may be ex officio members or liaisons from
groups or organizations with which the RSAB deems it necessary to
formally collaborate or coordinate.</t>

            <name>Appointment and Removal of Voting Members</name>
            <t>The appointing bodies (i.e., IESG, IAB, 
IRTF Chair, and ISE) shall determine their own processes for 
appointing RSAB members (note that processes related to the RSCE 
are described in <xref target="rsce"/>). Each appointing body shall have the power 
to remove its appointed RSAB member at its discretion at any time. 
Appointing bodies should ensure that voting members are seated at 
all times and should fill any vacancies with all due speed, if 
necessary on a temporary basis.</t>
            <t>In the case that the IRTF Chair or ISE is incapacitated or otherwise 
unable to appoint another person to serve as a delegate, 
the IAB (as the appointing body for the IRTF Chair and ISE)
shall act as the temporary appointing body for those

              <li>Activities related to implementation of policies already in force

<li>Voting on approval of policy documents produced by the RSWG shall be
delayed until the vacancy or vacancies have been filled, up to a maximum of
three (3) months. If a further vacancy arises during this three-month period, the
delay should be extended by up to another three months.  After the delay
period expires, the RSAB should continue to process documents as described
below. Note that this method of handling vacancies does not apply to a vacancy
of the RSCE role; it only applies to vacancies of the stream representatives
enumerated in <xref target="members"/>.

      <section anchor="process">
        <name>Process</name>
	<t> This section specifies the RFC Series Policy Definition Process, which shall be followed in producing all Editorial Stream RFCs.</t>
        <section anchor="intent">
          <name>Intent</name>
          <t>The intent is to provide an open forum by which policies related to the
RFC Series are defined and evolved. The general expectation is that all
interested parties will participate in the RSWG and that only under
extreme circumstances should RSAB members need to hold CONCERN
positions (as described in <xref target="workflow"/>).</t>
          <t>Because policy issues can be difficult and contentious, RSWG
participants and RSAB members are strongly encouraged to work together
in a spirit of good faith and mutual understanding to achieve rough
consensus (see <xref target="RFC2418"/>). In particular, RSWG members are
encouraged to take RSAB concerns seriously, and RSAB members are
encouraged to clearly express their concerns early in the process and
to be responsive to the community. All parties are encouraged to respect
the value of each stream and the long-term health and viability of
the RFC Series.</t>
          <t>This process is intended to be one of continuous consultation. RSAB
members should consult with their constituent stakeholders (e.g.,
authors, editors, tool developers, and consumers of RFCs) on an ongoing
basis, so that when the time comes to consider the approval of a proposal, there should
be no surprises. Appointing bodies are expected to establish whatever
processes they deem appropriate to facilitate this goal.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="workflow">
          <name>Workflow</name>
          <t>The following process shall be used to formulate or modify policies
related to the RFC Series:</t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>An individual or set of individuals generates a proposal in the form 
of an Internet-Draft (which must be submitted in full conformance
with the provisions of <xref target="BCP78"/> and <xref target="BCP79"/>)
and asks the RSWG to adopt the proposal as a working group item.</li>
<li>The RSWG may adopt the proposal as a working group item if 
the chairs determine (by following working group procedures for rough 
consensus) that there is sufficient interest in the proposal; this
is similar to the way a working group of the IETF would operate 
(see <xref target="RFC2418"/>).</li>
            <li>The RSWG shall then further discuss and develop the proposal. All
participants, but especially RSAB members, should pay special
attention to any aspects of the proposal that have the potential
to significantly modify long-standing policies or historical
characteristics of the RFC Series as described in <xref target="properties"/>.
Members of the RSAB are expected to participate as individuals in 
all discussions relating to RSWG proposals. This should help to 
ensure that they are fully aware of proposals early in the 
RFC Series Policy Definition Process. It should also help to ensure that RSAB members
will raise any issues or concerns during the development of the 
proposal and not wait until the RSAB review period. The RSWG Chairs 
are also expected to participate as individuals.</li>
            <li>At some point, if the RSWG Chairs believe there may be rough
consensus for the proposal to advance, they will issue a Last Call
for comments within the working group.</li>
            <li>After a comment period of suitable length, the RSWG Chairs will
determine whether rough consensus for the proposal exists (taking
their own feedback as individuals into account along with feedback
from other participants). If comments have been received and
substantial changes have been made, additional Last Calls may be
necessary. Once the chairs determine that consensus has been 
reached, they shall announce their determination on the RSWG
email discussion list and forward the document to the RSAB.</li>
            <li>Once consensus is established in the RSWG, the RSAB shall issue a
community call for comments as further described in <xref target="cfc"/>. If 
substantial comments are received in response to the community 
call for comments, the RSAB may return the proposal to the RSWG to 
consider those comments and make revisions to address the feedback
received. In parallel with the community call for comments, the RSAB
itself shall also consider the proposal.</li>
            <li>If the scope of the revisions made in the previous step is substantial, an 
additional community call for comments should be issued by the RSAB, 
and the feedback received should be considered by the RSWG.</li>
            <li>Once the RSWG Chairs confirm that concerns received during the
community call(s) for comments have been addressed, they shall
inform the RSAB that the document is ready for balloting by the
RSAB.</li>
            <li>
              <t anchor="step9">Within a reasonable period of time, the RSAB will poll its members 
for their positions on the proposal. Positions may be as follows:  </t>
              <ul spacing="normal">
                <li>YES: the proposal should be approved</li>
                <li>CONCERN: the proposal raises substantial concerns that must be
addressed</li>
                <li>RECUSE: the person holding the position has a conflict of
interest</li>
              </ul>
              <t>
Any RSAB member holding a CONCERN position must explain their concern
to the community in detail. Nevertheless, the RSWG might not be able to 
come to consensus on modifications that will address the RSAB member's 
concern.  </t>
              <t>
There are three reasons why an RSAB member may file a position of CONCERN:  </t>
              <ul spacing="normal">
                <li>The RSAB member believes that the proposal represents a serious 
problem for one or more of the individual streams.</li>
                <li>The RSAB member believes that the proposal would cause serious harm
to the overall RFC Series, including harm to the long-term health and
viability of the Series.</li>
                <li>The RSAB member believes, based on the results of the community 
call(s) for comments (<xref target="cfc"/>), that rough consensus to advance
the proposal is lacking.</li>
              </ul>
              <t>
Because RSAB members are expected to participate in the discussions 
within the RSWG and to raise any concerns and issues during those 
discussions, most CONCERN positions should not come as a surprise to 
the RSWG. Notwithstanding, late CONCERN positions are always possible
if issues are identified during RSAB review or the community call(s) for comments.</t>
            </li>
            <li>If a CONCERN exists, discussion will take place within the RSWG.
Again, all RSAB members are expected to participate. If substantial 
changes are made in order to address CONCERN positions, an additional 
community call for comments might be needed.</li>
            <li>A proposal without any CONCERN positions is approved.</li>

          <name>Community Calls for Comment</name>
          <t>The RSAB is responsible for initiating and managing community calls
for comments on proposals that have gained consensus within the RSWG.
The RSAB should actively seek a wide range of input. The RSAB seeks
such input by, at a minimum, sending a notice to the <eref target="mailto:rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org">rfc&nbhy;interest@rfc&nbhy;editor.org</eref>
email discussion list or to its successor or future equivalent. RSAB members
should also send a notice to the communities they directly represent
(e.g., the IETF and IRTF). Notices are also to be made available and
archived on the RFC Editor website. In addition, other communication
channels can be established for notices (e.g., via an RSS feed or by
posting to social media venues).</t>
          <t>In cases where a proposal has the potential to significantly modify
long-standing policies or historical characteristics of the RFC
Series as described in <xref target="properties"/>, the RSAB should take extra 
care to reach out to a very wide range of communities that make use of 
RFCs (as described in <xref target="participation"/>) since such communities
might not be actively engaged in the RSWG directly. The RSAB should 
work with the stream approving bodies and the IETF LLC to identify and 
establish contacts in such communities, assisted by the 
RSCE in particular.</t>
          <t>The RSAB should maintain a public list of communities that are
contacted during calls for comments.</t>
          <t>A notice of a community call for comments contains the following:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>A subject line beginning with 'Call for Comments:'</li>
            <li>A clear, concise summary of the proposal</li>
            <li>A URL pointing to the Internet-Draft that defines the proposal</li>
            <li>Any explanations or questions for the community that the RSAB deems
necessary (using their usual decision-making procedures)</li>
            <li>Clear instructions on how to provide public comments</li>
            <li>A deadline for comments</li>
          </ul>
          <t>A comment period will last not less than two weeks and should be
longer if wide outreach is required. Comments will be publicly
archived on the RFC Editor website.</t>
          <t>The RSAB is responsible for considering comments received during 
a community call for comments. If RSAB members conclude that such
comments raise important issues that need to be addressed, they 
should do so by discussing those issues within the RSWG or (if 
the issues meet the criteria specified in <xref target="step9" format="none">Step 9</xref> of <xref target="workflow"/>) 
lodging a position of CONCERN during RSAB balloting.</t>

the case of failure to act, of notice having been given to the RSWG Chairs.
The RSAB will then decide if the process was followed and will direct
the RSWG Chairs as to what procedural actions are required.</t>

        <t>A few general considerations apply:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The general roles and responsibilities of the RPC are defined by
RFCs published in the Editorial Stream (i.e., not directly by the
RSWG, RSAB, or RSCE), by existing RFCs that apply to the 
RPC and have not yet been superseded by Editorial Stream 
RFCs, and by the requisite contracts.</li>
          <li>The RPC is advised by the RSCE and RSAB, and it has a duty to
consult with them under specific circumstances, such as those
relating to disagreements between authors and the RPC as
described in <xref target="disagreements"/>.</li>
          <li>The RPC is overseen by the IETF LLC to ensure that
it performs in accordance with contracts in place.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>All matters of budget, timetable, and impact on its performance
targets are between the RPC and IETF LLC.</t>
        <t>The RPC shall regularly provide reports to the IETF LLC, RSAB, RSWG,
and broader community regarding its activities and any key risks or
issues affecting it.</t>
        <t>In the event that the RPC is required to make a decision without
consultation that would normally deserve consultation, or makes a
decision against the advice of the RSAB, the RPC must notify the
RSAB.</t>
        <t>This document does not specify the exact relationship between the
IETF LLC and the RPC; for example, the work of the RPC could be
performed by a separate corporate entity under contract to the
IETF LLC, it could be performed by employees of the IETF LLC, or
the IETF LLC could engage with independent contractors for some or
all aspects of such work. The exact relationship is a matter for
the IETF LLC to determine.</t>
        <t>The IETF LLC is responsible for the method and management of the
engagement of the RPC. Therefore, the IETF LLC has authority over
negotiating performance targets for the RPC and also has
responsibility for ensuring that those targets are met.  Such
performance targets are set based on the RPC's publication load and
additional efforts required to implement policies specified in
Editorial Stream RFCs, in existing RFCs that apply to the RPC and have
not yet been superseded by Editorial Stream RFCs, and in the requisite
contracts.  The IETF LLC may consult with the community regarding
these targets. The IETF LLC is empowered to appoint a manager or to
convene a committee to complete these activities.</t>
<t>If individuals or groups within the community have concerns about the
performance of the RPC, they can request that the matter be investigated
by the IETF LLC Board, the IETF Executive Director, or a point of 
contact designated by the IETF LLC Board. Even if the IETF LLC opts to 
delegate this activity, concerns should be raised with the IETF LLC.

        <name>Resolution of Disagreements between Authors and the RPC</name>
        <t>During the process of editorial preparation and publication, disagreements
can arise between the authors of an RFC-to-be and the RPC. Where an existing
policy clearly applies, typically such disagreements are handled in a
straightforward manner through direct consultation between the authors and
the RPC, sometimes in collaboration with stream-specific contacts.</t>
        <t>However, if it is unclear whether an existing policy applies or if it is 
unclear how to interpret an existing policy, the parties may need to
consult with additional individuals or bodies (e.g., RSAB, IESG, IRSG, or
stream approving bodies) to help achieve a resolution. The following points are
intended to provide more specific guidance.</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>If there is a conflict with a policy for a particular stream, to help 
achieve a resolution, the RPC should consult with the relevant stream 
approving body (such as the IESG or IRSG) and other representatives of 
the relevant stream as appropriate.</li>
          <li>If there is a conflict with a cross-stream policy, the RPC should consult
with the RSAB to achieve a resolution.</li>
          <li>The disagreement might raise a new issue that is not covered by an existing
policy or that cannot be resolved through consultation between the RPC and
other relevant individuals and bodies, as described above. In this case,
the RSAB is responsible for (a) resolving the disagreement in a timely manner
if necessary so that the relevant stream document(s) can be published before a 
new policy is defined and (b) bringing the issue to the RSWG so that a new policy

proposals that might have a detrimental effect on these properties
should receive heightened scrutiny during RSWG discussion and RSAB

      <t>Updates, amendments, and refinements to this document can be produced 
using the process documented herein but shall be published and operative only after 
(a) obtaining the agreement of the IAB and the IESG and (b) ensuring
that the IETF LLC has no objections regarding its ability to implement 
any proposed changes.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="changes">
      <name>Changes from Version 2 of the RFC Editor Model</name>
      <t>The processes and organizational models for publication of RFCs
have changed significantly over the years. Most recently, in 2009,
<xref target="RFC5620"/> defined the RFC Editor Model (Version 1), and in 2012,
<xref target="RFC6635"/> defined the RFC Editor Model (Version 2), which was then
modified slightly in 2020 by <xref target="RFC8728"/>.</t>
      <t>However, the community experienced several problems with versions 1 
and 2, including a lack of transparency, a lack of avenues 
for community input into policy definition, and unclear lines of 
authority and responsibility.</t>
      <t>To address these problems, in 2020, the IAB formed the RFC Editor 
Future Development Program to conduct a community discussion and 
consensus process for the further evolution of the RFC Editor Model. 
Under the auspices of this Program, the community considered changes 
that would increase transparency and community input regarding the 
definition of policies for the RFC Series as a whole, while at 
the same time ensuring the continuity of the RFC Series, 
maintaining the quality and timely publication of RFCs, 
ensuring document accessibility, and clarifying lines of 
authority and responsibility.</t>
      <t>This document is the result of discussion within the Program and
describes version 3 of the RFC Editor Model while remaining 
consistent with <xref target="RFC8729"/>.</t>
      <t>The following sections describe the changes from version 2 in 
more detail.</t>
      <section anchor="rfc-editor-function">
        <name>RFC Editor Function</name>
        <t>Several responsibilities previously assigned to the RFC Editor
or, more precisely, the RFC Editor function, are now performed
by the RSWG, RSAB, RPC, RSCE, and IETF LLC (alone or in combination).
These include various aspects of strategic leadership 
(<xref target="RFC8728" sectionFormat="of" section="2.1.1"/>), representation of the RFC Series 
(<xref target="RFC8728" sectionFormat="of" section="2.1.2"/>), development of RFC production and
publication (<xref target="RFC8728" sectionFormat="of" section="2.1.3"/>), development of the
RFC Series (<xref target="RFC8728" sectionFormat="of" section="2.1.4"/>), operational oversight
(<xref target="RFC8729" sectionFormat="of" section="3.3"/>), policy oversight 
(<xref target="RFC8729" sectionFormat="of" section="3.4"/>), the editing, processing, and publication of
documents (<xref target="RFC8729" sectionFormat="of" section="4.2"/>), and development and
maintenance of guidelines and rules that apply to the RFC Series
(<xref target="RFC8729" sectionFormat="of" section="4.4"/>). Among other things, this changes the dependency on
the RFC Series Editor (RSE) included in <xref target="RFC8730" sectionFormat="of" section="2.2"/> with regard to 
"coordinating work and conforming to general RFC Series policies
as specified by the IAB and RSE." In addition, various details 
regarding these responsibilities have been modified to accord with 
the framework defined in this document.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="rfc-series-editor">
        <name>RFC Series Editor</name>
        <t>Implied by the changes outlined in the previous section, the
responsibilities of the RFC Series Editor (RSE) as a person or
role (contrasted with the overall RFC Editor function) are now
split or shared among the RSWG, RSAB, RSCE, RPC, and IETF LLC (alone
or in combination). More specifically, the responsibilities of
the RFC Series Consulting Editor (RSCE) under version 3 of the RFC
Editor Model differ in many ways from the responsibilities of the
RFC Series Editor under version 2 of the RFC Editor Model. In general,
references in existing documents to the RSE can be taken as
referring to the RFC Editor function as described herein but
should not be taken as referring to the RSCE.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="rfc-publisher">
        <name>RFC Publisher</name>
        <t>In practice, the RFC Production Center (RPC) and RFC Publisher roles
have been performed by the same entity, and this practice is expected
to continue; therefore, this document dispenses with the distinction
between these roles and refers only to the RPC.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="iab">
        <name>IAB</name>
        <t>Under earlier versions of the RFC Editor Model, the IAB was
responsible for oversight of the RFC Series and acted as a body
for final conflict resolution regarding the RFC Series. The IAB's
authority in these matters is described in the IAB Charter
(<xref target="RFC2850"/>, as updated by <xref target="RFC9283"/>).
Under version 2 of the RFC Editor Model, the IAB delegated some
of its authority to the RFC Series Oversight Committee (see <xref target="rsoc"/>).
Under version 3 of the RFC Editor Model, authority for policy definition
resides with the RSWG as an independent venue for work by members
of the community (with approval of policy proposals being the
responsibility of the RSAB, which represents the streams and includes
the RSCE), whereas authority for policy implementation resides with
the IETF LLC.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="rsoc">
        <name>RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC)</name>
        <t>In practice, the relationships and lines of authority and responsibility
between the IAB, RSOC, and RSE have proved unwieldy and somewhat opaque.
To overcome some of these issues, this document dispenses with the RSOC.
References to the RSOC in documents such as <xref target="RFC8730"/> are obsolete
because this document disbands the RSOC.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="rfc-series-advisory-group-rsag">
        <name>RFC Series Advisory Group (RSAG)</name>
        <t>Version 1 of the RFC Editor Model <xref target="RFC5620"/> specified the existence of
the RFC Series Advisory Group (RSAG), which was no longer specified in
version 2 of the RFC Editor Model. For the avoidance of doubt, this document affirms
that the RSAG has been disbanded. (The RSAG is not to be confused with the
RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB), which this document establishes.)</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="editorial-stream-1">
        <name>Editorial Stream</name>
        <t>This document creates the Editorial Stream in addition to the streams
already described in <xref target="RFC8729"/>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="security-considerations">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>The same security considerations as those in <xref target="RFC8729"/> apply.
The processes for the publication of documents must prevent the
introduction of unapproved changes. Because multiple entities 
described in this document (most especially the RPC) participate in 
maintenance of the index of publications, sufficient security must be in place to
prevent these published documents from being changed by external
parties. The archive of RFC documents, any source documents needed
to recreate the RFC documents, and any associated original documents
(such as lists of errata, tools, and, for some early items, originals
that are not machine-readable) need to be secured against
data storage failure.</t>
      <t>The IETF LLC (along with any other contracting or contracted entities) 
should take these security considerations into account
during the implementation and enforcement of any relevant contracts.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="iana-considerations">
      <name>IANA Considerations</name>
      <t>The RPC is responsible for coordinating with the IANA to ensure that
RFCs accurately document registration processes and assigned values
for IANA registries.</t>
      <t>The IETF LLC facilitates management of the relationship between the RPC 
and IANA.</t>
      <t>This document does not create a new registry nor does it register any
values in existing registries, and no IANA action is required.</t>
